					</b> - the capital and largest city of Ukraine. 
					<br>
					It is located in the northern part of Central Ukraine, serving as the administrative center of the Kyiv Oblast, 
					situated on the banks of the Dnieper River. 
					The seventh largest city in Europe by population.

					<b>History</b>
					<br><br>
					Founded at the end of the 5th to the beginning of the 6th century.<br>
					It was the capital of the Polans, Kyiv Rus, Ukrainian People's Republic, Ukrainian State, and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.<br>
					It also served as the administrative center of the corresponding principality, the Lithuanian-Polish voivodeship, Cossack regiment, 
					Russian governorate, and German general district.<br><br>

				<font size = "4" face = "Calibri">
					<i>According to the legend in the "Primary Chronicle," Kyiv was founded by the legendary Polian prince Kyiv along with his brothers 
					Shchek and Khoryv and their sister Lybid.
					In 2005, the capital of Ukraine became the host city for the 50th Eurovision Song Contest, and in 2012, 
					it was one of the four Ukrainian cities that hosted the UEFA European Football Championship EURO 2012.</i>

					<b>Interesting historical places in the capital</b>
					<br><br>
					Associated with significant events in Ukraine's history, these places and monuments preserve the memory of ancestors.
					One of them is the Golden Gate, located near the Opera Theater, on Volodymyrska Street, 40A. 
					This monument is a defensive structure from the times of Kyivan Rus, which served as the main entrance to the city. 
					It consists of an original preserved part and a reconstructed section. The Gate was built by order of Yaroslav the Wise.
					Another crucial period in history that should not be forgotten is the infamous Babi Yar. Situated near Dorohozhychi metro station, 
					it became a mass grave for over 100,000 Kyiv residents during the war from 1941 to 1943.
